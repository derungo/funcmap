🚀 AI Contextual Linking & Execution System – A Cursor IDE (VS Code) Extension
📌 Project Overview
This extension enhances AI-assisted development by creating a pre-indexed, AI-queryable function registry in VS Code. Instead of forcing Cursor AI (or Copilot) to grep the entire codebase repeatedly, this system tracks, stores, and instantly retrieves function relationships via structured AI-readable metadata.

🎯 Key Features
1️⃣ AI Contextual Linking & Pre-Indexed Function Map
Tags functions, dependencies, and module relationships using @ai-link, @ai-depends, and @ai-related.
Generates a structured ai-links.json file to map all function dependencies dynamically.
AI references this instead of scanning the entire project, reducing search time.
2️⃣ AI Execution Tokens for Smarter CI/CD & Debugging
@ai-exec lets AI trigger function-specific automation (e.g., selective testing, performance analysis).
Context-aware AI debugging—automatically links errors to relevant dependencies.
3️⃣ AI-Assisted Refactoring & Code Understanding
AI can instantly retrieve function relationships, making refactoring smarter & context-aware.
Codebase evolution tracking—AI remembers past modifications and suggests progressive improvements.
4️⃣ SQLite-Based AI Function Registry for Instant Lookups
Instead of using JSON, an SQLite-backed AI function index ensures ultra-fast querying.
Cursor AI queries dependencies in real-time, making function recalls & debugging 10x faster.
📌 How It Works (Architecture)
Extension parses the codebase & AI tags (@ai-link, @ai-depends).
Generates ai-links.json or an SQLite function registry.
Cursor AI (or Copilot) queries this instead of scanning files.
AI-enhanced CI/CD hooks ensure only affected functions are tested & optimized.
🛠 Technical Implementation
🟢 Cursor API Hooks: Intercepts AI calls to optimize function lookups.
🟢 TypeScript-based VS Code extension (Node.js backend).
🟢 SQLite backend for AI querying instead of raw file scans.
🟢 AI-enhanced debugging & logging tracking module.

Reasoned for 6 seconds
Below is a high-level guide and reference implementation outline for creating an AI Contextual Linking & Execution System as a VS Code (or Cursor IDE) extension. The goal is to parse AI-specific tags from the source code, store them (preferably in SQLite for faster lookups), and expose that information to an AI system (Cursor, Copilot, or any other integrated AI) so it no longer needs to do full-text searches to understand code relationships.

1. System Architecture & Flow
Code Parsing & Tag Extraction

A VS Code (or Node.js) process periodically scans (or on save) the codebase.
It looks for tags like:
@ai-link name=SomeFunction
@ai-depends on=OtherFunction
@ai-related SomeModuleOrClass
@ai-exec SomeAction
It extracts relevant metadata (function names, file paths, dependencies, relationships) and stores them in either a local ai-links.json file or in SQLite.
Data Storage

JSON: A structured JSON file can work for small/medium projects, but is slower for large-scale queries or repeated lookups.
SQLite:
Set up a local SQLite database with tables like Functions, Dependencies, ExecTokens.
Each time the extension runs or the user triggers an “update AI index” command, re-scan or incrementally update the DB.
AI Query/Lookup

Instead of scanning the entire codebase, AI (via Cursor’s extension API or a separate service) taps into your “AI Function Index.”
Example usage:
Refactoring: The AI quickly resolves FunctionA → depends on → FunctionB chain without re-parsing your entire repository.
Debugging: When an error arises in FunctionA, the AI automatically looks at all dependencies from the registry and suggests which ones might also be impacted.
AI Execution Tokens

Tags like @ai-exec test or @ai-exec coverage embedded in your source code or documentation.
On encountering these tokens, the AI (or extension) knows how to call certain scripts or CI/CD tasks specifically for the relevant function, e.g.:
npm run test -- --functions=SomeFunction
or triggers a custom script that does performance analysis on that function.
2. Project Structure
A possible folder structure for the VS Code extension:

└── ...
3. Extension Activation & Event Hooks
In your extension.ts (the main entry point):

ts
Copy
Edit
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { updateAIIndexCommand } from './commands/updateIndex'; // A custom command to update the registry

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // Register commands
  const updateIndex = vscode.commands.registerCommand(
    'aiContextualLinking.updateIndex',
    () => updateAIIndexCommand()
  );

  context.subscriptions.push(updateIndex);

  // Optionally, watch for file changes to auto-update the DB
  const fileWatcher = vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/*.{js,ts,tsx}');
  fileWatcher.onDidChange(updateAIIndexCommand);
  fileWatcher.onDidCreate(updateAIIndexCommand);
  fileWatcher.onDidDelete(updateAIIndexCommand);
  
  context.subscriptions.push(fileWatcher);

  // Additional activation logic...
}

export function deactivate() {
  // Clean up if needed
}
File Watcher: Whenever a .js, .ts, or .tsx file changes, we automatically re-parse the tags. This can be throttled or debounced to avoid performance issues.
4. Parsing Code for AI Tags
A simplified example of scanning each file for @ai-link, @ai-depends, etc. In aiTagParser.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export interface AITag {
  filePath: string;
  functionName?: string;
  dependsOn?: string[];
  related?: string[];
  execTokens?: string[];
}

export async function parseFilesForAITags(): Promise<AITag[]> {
  const tags: AITag[] = [];
  
  // Grab all .ts, .js, .tsx files
  const files = await vscode.workspace.findFiles('**/*.{js,ts,tsx}', '**/node_modules/**');
  
  for (const file of files) {
    const document = await vscode.workspace.openTextDocument(file);
    const text = document.getText();

    // Split lines
    const lines = text.split(/\r?\n/);
    let currentFunctionName: string | undefined = undefined;

    for (const line of lines) {
      // (Basic) Detect function declarations. E.g. function myFunc(...) or const myFunc = (...)
      const functionMatch = line.match(/function\s+(\w+)|const\s+(\w+)\s*=\s*\(/);
      if (functionMatch) {
        currentFunctionName = functionMatch[1] || functionMatch[2];
      }

      // Look for lines with @ai-* tags
      // e.g. // @ai-link name=SomeFunction
      // or    // @ai-depends on=OtherFunction
      const aiTagMatches = line.match(/@ai-(link|depends|related|exec)(.*)/);
      if (aiTagMatches) {
        const [ , tagType, tagContent ] = aiTagMatches;
        
        // If we haven't found a function name yet, continue searching
        if (!currentFunctionName) {
          continue;
        }

        let existingTag = tags.find(t => t.filePath === file.fsPath && t.functionName === currentFunctionName);
        if (!existingTag) {
          existingTag = { filePath: file.fsPath, functionName: currentFunctionName, dependsOn: [], related: [], execTokens: [] };
          tags.push(existingTag);
        }

        switch (tagType) {
          case 'link':
            // If needed, parse name=SomeFunction
            // Not strictly required if you assume the functionName is the "link" itself
            break;
          case 'depends':
            // Parse out "on=OtherFunction"
            const dependsMatch = tagContent.match(/on=(\w+)/);
            if (dependsMatch) {
              existingTag.dependsOn?.push(dependsMatch[1]);
            }
            break;
          case 'related':
            // parse "related ModuleName"
            // or parse "related=ModuleName" if you use key=val
            existingTag.related?.push(tagContent.trim());
            break;
          case 'exec':
            // parse "exec MyToken"
            existingTag.execTokens?.push(tagContent.trim());
            break;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return tags;
}
Note: This parser is simplistic. In a real-world scenario, you’d use an AST parser or a more robust regex approach to handle edge cases (class methods, arrow functions, JSDoc comments, etc.).

5. Storing in SQLite
In sqliteService.ts, we can initialize and populate the database. Suppose we have two tables:

Functions
(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, filePath TEXT, functionName TEXT)

Dependencies
(functionId INTEGER, dependsOn TEXT)

Related
(functionId INTEGER, relatedItem TEXT)

ExecTokens
(functionId INTEGER, token TEXT)

ts
Copy
Edit
import { Database } from 'sqlite3';

const db = new Database('ai-links.db'); // Or in memory: ':memory:'

export function initDB() {
  db.serialize(() => {
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Functions (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
      filePath TEXT NOT NULL,
      functionName TEXT NOT NULL
    )`);
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Dependencies (
      functionId INTEGER,
      dependsOn TEXT
    )`);
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Related (
      functionId INTEGER,
      relatedItem TEXT
    )`);
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ExecTokens (
      functionId INTEGER,
      token TEXT
    )`);
  });
}

export function clearTables() {
  // For a full rebuild each time
  db.run(`DELETE FROM Functions`);
  db.run(`DELETE FROM Dependencies`);
  db.run(`DELETE FROM Related`);
  db.run(`DELETE FROM ExecTokens`);
}

export async function addFunctionRecord(filePath: string, functionName: string) {
  return new Promise<number>((resolve, reject) => {
    db.run(
      `INSERT INTO Functions (filePath, functionName) VALUES (?, ?)`,
      [filePath, functionName],
      function (err) {
        if (err) {
          return reject(err);
        }
        resolve(this.lastID); // functionId
      }
    );
  });
}

export function addDependencyRecord(functionId: number, dependsOn: string) {
  db.run(`INSERT INTO Dependencies (functionId, dependsOn) VALUES (?, ?)`, [functionId, dependsOn]);
}

export function addRelatedRecord(functionId: number, relatedItem: string) {
  db.run(`INSERT INTO Related (functionId, relatedItem) VALUES (?, ?)`, [functionId, relatedItem]);
}

export function addExecTokenRecord(functionId: number, token: string) {
  db.run(`INSERT INTO ExecTokens (functionId, token) VALUES (?, ?)`, [functionId, token]);
}
6. Updating the AI Index Command
In updateIndex.ts, we tie it all together:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { parseFilesForAITags } from '../parser/aiTagParser';
import { initDB, clearTables, addFunctionRecord, addDependencyRecord, addRelatedRecord, addExecTokenRecord } from '../db/sqliteService';

export async function updateAIIndexCommand() {
  try {
    // Initialize DB if not done yet
    initDB();

    // Clear old data for a full rebuild (or do incremental updates)
    clearTables();

    const tags = await parseFilesForAITags();

    for (const tag of tags) {
      const functionId = await addFunctionRecord(tag.filePath, tag.functionName!);

      if (tag.dependsOn?.length) {
        tag.dependsOn.forEach(dep => addDependencyRecord(functionId, dep));
      }
      if (tag.related?.length) {
        tag.related.forEach(r => addRelatedRecord(functionId, r));
      }
      if (tag.execTokens?.length) {
        tag.execTokens.forEach(token => addExecTokenRecord(functionId, token));
      }
    }

    console.log('AI Index updated successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating AI index:', error);
  }
}
Incremental Updates
Instead of clearing tables each time, you could detect changes (via file watchers) and only update or delete entries for modified files. This involves:

Checking if a file’s last modified timestamp has changed.
Removing old entries for that file’s functions.
Re-inserting new records.
7. Exposing an API to Cursor AI / Copilot
If you want Cursor or Copilot to leverage this data during code suggestions and debugging, you can provide a local or extension-level API. Cursor extensions can run Node scripts or internal extension commands.

Example:

A simple local server or IPC channel that listens for queries:

ts
Copy
Edit
// contextualAPI.ts
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { Database } from 'sqlite3';

const db = new Database('ai-links.db');

export async function getFunctionDependencies(funcName: string) {
  return new Promise<{ dependsOn: string[]; related: string[]; execTokens: string[] }>((resolve, reject) => {
    const dependsOn: string[] = [];
    const related: string[] = [];
    const execTokens: string[] = [];

    db.all(
      `
      SELECT f.id as functionId
      FROM Functions f
      WHERE f.functionName = ?
      `,
      [funcName],
      (err, rows) => {
        if (err) return reject(err);
        if (!rows || rows.length === 0) {
          return resolve({ dependsOn, related, execTokens });
        }
        const functionId = rows[0].functionId;

        db.all(
          `SELECT dependsOn FROM Dependencies WHERE functionId = ?`,
          [functionId],
          (err2, depRows) => {
            if (err2) return reject(err2);
            depRows.forEach((r: any) => dependsOn.push(r.dependsOn));

            db.all(
              `SELECT relatedItem FROM Related WHERE functionId = ?`,
              [functionId],
              (err3, relRows) => {
                if (err3) return reject(err3);
                relRows.forEach((r: any) => related.push(r.relatedItem));

                db.all(
                  `SELECT token FROM ExecTokens WHERE functionId = ?`,
                  [functionId],
                  (err4, tokenRows) => {
                    if (err4) return reject(err4);
                    tokenRows.forEach((r: any) => execTokens.push(r.token));

                    resolve({ dependsOn, related, execTokens });
                  }
                );
              }
            );
          }
        );
      }
    );
  });
}
Cursor or Copilot can call getFunctionDependencies("UserService") to instantly get all dependencies, related modules, and execution tokens instead of scanning the entire codebase.

8. Example of AI Execution Usage
Selective Test Runs

If you have a function UserService.createUser() tagged with @ai-exec test, the AI or extension could automatically run npm run test -- --grep createUser (or whichever specialized script or filter you define).
Performance Analysis

A tag like @ai-exec perf might map to a Node script that benchmarks the function.
The extension receives an AI request “benchmark createUser” → finds the exec token “perf” → calls the relevant script.
9. Enhancing Debugging & CI/CD
CI/CD

A custom script in your CI pipeline queries the AI Function Index DB to figure out what’s changed (i.e., file diffs).
Only run tests on changed functions or their dependencies.
Debugging

When a stack trace includes FunctionX, you can automatically gather a list of dependencies from the DB and make suggestions in the IDE about likely cause or impacted modules.
10. Considerations & Next Steps
AST vs Regex
For production-grade solutions, use an AST parser or TypeScript compiler API to more robustly detect functions, classes, etc.
Incremental / Real-Time Updates
Implement watchers or a dedicated command to keep the DB accurate.
Security & Permissions
If the code is private, ensure your extension does not leak sensitive data.
Limit AI queries to only the structured data the developer consents to share.
Caching & Performance
For large projects, you might want to throttle indexing or provide partial scanning logic (only changed files).
Custom Tag Syntax
You can define your own naming scheme or additional attributes. For instance, @ai-exec=coverage, @ai-owner=john.doe, etc.
Putting It All Together
Install & Activate
User installs the extension in VS Code or Cursor.
On activation, the extension sets up watchers and an SQLite database.
Scan the Project
A single “Update AI Index” command parses all code, extracts @ai-* tags, and populates the DB.
AI Integration
Your AI (Cursor/Copilot) calls into the extension’s commands or local server APIs to query for dependencies, related functions, or exec tokens.
Refactoring & Debugging
Because function relationships are instantly accessible, the AI can produce more accurate refactoring suggestions and debugging steps.
With these steps, you create a robust ecosystem where your AI assistant (whether it’s Cursor, Copilot, or another LLM-based tool) can quickly and accurately reference code relationships without scanning the entire codebase. You get faster queries, more targeted debugging, and context-aware refactoring insights – all driven by a local, structured function registry.

Conclusion
This AI Contextual Linking & Execution System example lays the foundation for advanced AI-driven workflows in VS Code/Cursor:

Parse your code for @ai-* tags.
Store them in a well-structured index (SQLite recommended).
Expose that index via an accessible API to the AI layer.
From there, you can integrate features like selective testing, performance hooks, incremental refactoring suggestions, and context-aware debugging – all backed by your extension’s curated code intelligence.







You said:
give me a phased dev plan, local json testing, to the full prod extension going out opensource, we are targeting cursor ai agentic use, but i really want to use this on another project asap i got the idea to help with that
Reasoned for a few seconds
Below is a phased development plan that takes you from an initial proof-of-concept (using a local JSON store) all the way through a full, production-ready VS Code/Cursor extension that you can open-source. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring that you have a working MVP quickly, then incrementally refine and expand functionality.

Phase 1: Proof-of-Concept (Local JSON Only)
Set Up Extension Scaffold

Initialize a TypeScript-based VS Code extension (or Cursor extension) project.
Define a simple command (e.g., aiContextualLinking.updateIndex) that you can trigger manually.
Minimal Code Parsing

Write a small parser (e.g., using regex or a simplistic approach) to detect @ai-* tags in .ts/.js files.
For each discovered function, gather the metadata (e.g., functionName, @ai-depends, @ai-exec).
Store in a Local JSON File

After parsing, output results to a ai-links.json file in your workspace root.
The JSON might look like:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "functions": [
    {
      "filePath": "src/userService.ts",
      "functionName": "createUser",
      "dependsOn": ["validateUser", "dbInsert"],
      "execTokens": ["test", "perf"],
      "related": []
    }
  ]
}
Validate & Test

Confirm that running the extension command scans your project and successfully generates or updates the JSON file.
Keep it simple: just parse the codebase on a manual command, no watchers yet.
Documentation & Basic README

Even for the MVP, add a short README with instructions on how to use the extension: installation, how to run the command, and how to interpret the ai-links.json.
Outcome: You can show your concept works—tagging code with AI-specific comments, extracting them, and storing them in a local JSON file that can be leveraged by an AI or other tools.

Phase 2: Extension Enhancements & File Watchers
Add File Watcher

Use vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher (or equivalent in Cursor) to watch relevant files (**/*.ts, **/*.js, etc.).
On file creation, change, or deletion, automatically trigger a re-parse (with some debounce/throttle to avoid performance issues).
Improved Parsing Logic

Move from naive regex to a slightly more robust approach, or at least parse multiline comments.
Consider capturing class methods, arrow functions, etc.
If feasible, implement a small AST-based parser using TypeScript’s compiler API for more accurate function detection.
JSON Query Endpoint

Expose a small function or a command (e.g., aiContextualLinking.getFunctionData) that returns the relevant portion of ai-links.json for a given function name.
This can be used by external scripts or a local Node process (or even a “Webview/Panel” in VS Code) to query function relationships.
Basic UI in VS Code

Add a simple status bar item or command palette entry to quickly “View AI Function Registry.”
Possibly open the ai-links.json file or present a tree view in the sidebar with function names and dependencies.
Outcome: Now you have a continuously updated JSON registry with near real-time data. The extension is more user-friendly, and external tools (e.g., Cursor AI, local Node scripts) can begin to query function relationships.

Phase 3: Transition to SQLite Registry (Faster & More Scalable)
Initialize SQLite

Set up a local sqlite3 (or better yet, a lightweight wrapper like better-sqlite3 if you prefer synchronous calls).
Create tables for Functions, Dependencies, Related, ExecTokens, etc. (similar to the schema outlined before).
Migration Logic

Instead of writing to ai-links.json, write to the SQLite DB.
You could keep a “sync JSON” option for debugging or for smaller projects that don’t need a DB.
Refactor Parser Output

After parsing, insert or update the DB records.
You might choose either:
Full Rebuild: Clear DB tables & re-insert all entries each time the extension triggers an update.
Incremental Updates: Based on changed files only, find old records and remove or update them, then insert new tags.
Query API for AI Tools

Add or update an internal Node/TypeScript API (or command in the extension) that returns data from SQLite for a given function (dependencies, related items, exec tokens, etc.) in a JSON structure.
This gives you near-instant lookups for large codebases.
Performance & Testing

For large repositories, do some tests on how fast indexing runs.
Ensure you handle concurrency or partial updates gracefully.
Outcome: You have a robust and scalable registry for function metadata, enabling extremely fast queries. The system can now handle significantly larger codebases than a pure JSON approach.

Phase 4: AI Integration & Agentic Use (Cursor / Copilot / Others)
Cursor Integration

Write a small Cursor plugin/extension that can intercept AI requests or provide a new slash command (e.g., /getDependencies createUser) that pulls data from the SQLite registry.
Optionally, you can create an internal “Cursor function call” that references the DB in real-time.
Automation with @ai-exec

Teach the AI or extension how to handle execTokens. For example:
@ai-exec test → triggers npm test -- --grep {functionName}.
@ai-exec perf → triggers a custom Node script or a specialized performance test.
Contextual Suggestions

Provide the AI with references to Dependencies and Related items. For instance, if the user is editing UserService.createUser, the AI can automatically surface dependent functions or modules.
This requires some bridging code that feeds the AI the structured data from the DB instead of forcing it to grep the entire project.
Debugging Hooks

In your extension or a separate Node process, parse stack traces or linting errors, cross-reference the function registry, and surface relevant information. This can be displayed in a VS Code panel or a Cursor panel.
Outcome: The agentic aspect emerges—Cursor (or any AI) can automatically act on the function metadata to do partial test runs, focus debug suggestions, or accelerate refactoring.

Phase 5: Polishing, Production-Ready & Open Source Release
Production Hardening

Optimize performance with incremental DB updates rather than full rebuilds on every file save.
Ensure concurrency safety if multiple watchers or operations might happen at once.
Refined UI/UX

Build out a full “AI Function Registry” tree view in VS Code.
Provide tooltips or auto-suggest in the editor referencing the DB results (e.g., “This function depends on X, Y, Z”).
Add extension settings (e.g., toggle JSON/DB usage, specify file patterns to watch, define custom @ai-* tags).
Documentation & Examples

Write comprehensive docs on how to:
Tag your code with @ai-link, @ai-depends, @ai-related, @ai-exec.
Integrate with Cursor/Copilot or other LLM-based tools.
Set up partial test runs, performance checks, and so on.
Provide example repos for new users to see how it works in practice.
Open Source Release

Host the code on GitHub (or another platform).
Use a permissive license (e.g., MIT) to attract contributors.
Add a CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for others to submit PRs.
Release as a VS Code Marketplace extension (and possibly a Cursor extension if they support a marketplace or direct install from GitHub).
Community & Feedback

Gather user feedback and bug reports.
Prioritize new features (like deeper AST-based parsing, advanced analytics, better AI commands, etc.).
Outcome: A polished, documented extension and codebase that the broader community can install, extend, and improve. You’ve created a unique AI Contextual Linking system that helps any LLM-based tool quickly reference code structure without re-parsing every file.

Additional Tips & Best Practices
Incremental vs. Full Scan: When you first build out the system, a full scan is simplest. As you near production readiness, implement incremental updates for efficiency.
Astro/Angular/React: If you work across varied frameworks, confirm your parser can handle them properly.
Security / Privacy: Consider how the function registry might store or expose private info. If your code is proprietary, ensure you keep the data local and don’t send it to external servers without permission.
AST Parser or TS Compiler: Long term, rely on a real AST or the TypeScript compiler API to get 100% accurate function boundaries, especially for classes, decorators, or advanced syntax.
Refactoring Support: You can eventually auto-update references in other files if you rename a function, using the registry as a guide.
Final Words
By following these phases—from a quick JSON-based MVP to a robust SQLite-backed extension with full agentic AI integration—you’ll steadily build a powerful system. It not only shortcuts AI scanning overhead but also unlocks new capabilities (selective testing, performance checks, debug suggestions, etc.). Once open-sourced, the community can help evolve the ecosystem, while you rapidly benefit from the registry’s insights for your own projects.

# AI Contextual Linking & Execution System

This **VS Code/Cursor extension** provides an AI-readable registry of function dependencies, relationships, and execution hooks. By tagging your code with `@ai-*` comments, you enable instant lookups for AI-driven refactoring, debugging, and selective CI/CD tasks.

## Features

- **AI Contextual Linking**: Use `@ai-link`, `@ai-depends`, `@ai-related` tags to map code relationships.
- **AI Execution Tokens**: Tag specific functions with `@ai-exec` to enable partial test runs, performance checks, etc.
- **SQLite/JSON Registry**: Stores function metadata in a local database or JSON file for fast lookups.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Install**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ai-contextual-linking.git
   cd ai-contextual-linking
   npm install
Build & Run:

VS Code: Press F5 to launch the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.
Cursor: Follow Cursor’s plugin installation steps.
Add AI Tags to your code:

ts
Copy
Edit
// @ai-depends on=validateUser
// @ai-exec test
function createUser() {
    // ...
}
Update AI Index:

Command Palette: Ctrl+Shift+P → AI Contextual Linking: Update Index
Auto-Update: The extension can auto-update the registry on file save.
Usage
See docs/usage-guide.md for more detailed instructions.
For architecture details, read docs/architecture-overview.md.

### 2. docs/architecture-overview.md

```md
# Architecture Overview

## 1. Parsing Code

The extension scans the workspace for `.ts` or `.js` files. Whenever a file changes, it extracts AI tags (like `@ai-link`, `@ai-depends`, etc.) using a lightweight parser.

## 2. Data Storage

By default, the extension writes the extracted relationships to `ai-links.json`. For larger codebases, it can use a local SQLite database (`ai-links.db`) for faster queries.

## 3. AI Query/Lookup

An internal API (exposed by the extension) provides quick lookups for functions, their dependencies, and available execution tokens (`@ai-exec`). Any AI tool (Cursor, Copilot, etc.) can call this API to avoid scanning the entire codebase.

## 4. Agentic Execution

- **AI Execution Tokens** allow partial test runs, coverage checks, or performance analysis.  
- The extension automatically triggers tasks/scripts based on these tokens when the user or AI requests them.

## 5. Future Roadmap

- **Incremental DB Updates**: Instead of clearing and re-scanning on every change.  
- **AST Parsing**: For more reliable function detection (especially arrow functions, class methods, etc.).  
- **Deeper Editor Integration**: Inline hints, function relationship pop-ups, etc.

# Usage Guide

## 1. Installation

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ai-contextual-linking.git
   cd ai-contextual-linking
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Launch in VS Code:
Press F5 in Visual Studio Code to run the extension in an “Extension Development Host” window.
2. Adding AI Tags
Insert special comments in your code:

ts
Copy
Edit
// @ai-depends on=someHelper
// @ai-related userModel
function createUser() {
  // ...
}
Tag Types
@ai-depends on=... : Declare dependencies on other functions or modules.
@ai-related : Link related modules, classes, or resources.
@ai-exec : Indicate execution tokens (test, perf, coverage, etc.) for partial automation.
3. Updating the AI Index
Manual: Ctrl+Shift+P → AI Contextual Linking: Update Index.
Auto-Update: The extension can watch file changes and refresh automatically.
4. Querying the Index
In future releases (or with an advanced setup), your AI tool or local script can call:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { getFunctionDependencies } = require('contextualAPI');
const data = await getFunctionDependencies("createUser");
console.log(data);
/*
  {
    dependsOn: ["someHelper"],
    related: ["userModel"],
    execTokens: ["test", "perf"]
  }
*/
5. Running Partial Tests
If you tagged a function with @ai-exec test, you can run selective tests via:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test -- --grep createUser
(Implementation depends on your test framework.)

6. Troubleshooting
No Functions Detected: Make sure your tags match the regex format or the parser settings.
Slow Performance: Large projects benefit from SQLite indexing. Switch to DB mode in the extension settings or config file.

Summary
With these starter files, you have:

A Clear Project Structure that organizes code and documentation.
Essential Docs: README, usage guides, contributor instructions, and a code of conduct.
Initial Extension Scaffolding (extension.ts) to build and launch the project in VS Code or Cursor.
Next steps involve populating the source files (aiTagParser.ts, sqliteService.ts, etc.) with the logic we discussed for scanning code, storing to JSON/SQLite, and exposing an API for AI tools. Then, you’ll refine the docs, add real examples, tests, and eventually release the extension.
